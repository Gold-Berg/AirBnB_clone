# AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter

## Background Context
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project involves building a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects, serving as the foundational step towards creating a complete web application. It is crucial as it sets the stage for subsequent projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.

Before starting, familiarize yourself with the AirBnB concept by referring to the AirBnB concept page.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to construct a command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects. The command interpreter will handle tasks related to object creation, modification, deletion, and display.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirBnB_clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd AirBnB_clone
   ```

3. Run the command interpreter.
   ```bash
   ./console.py
   ```

## Features
- **Command Structure:** The CLI follows a specific command structure to execute various tasks.
- **Object Management:** Create, update, delete, and display AirBnB objects.
- **Task Dependencies:** Each task is linked and contributes to subsequent projects such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.

## How to Use
1. Enter commands in the console prompt following the specified syntax.
   ```bash
   (hbnb) command arguments
   ```

2. Explore the functionalities related to object management.

## Tasks
The project consists of multiple tasks, each designed to build on the previous one. Refer to the project's task documentation for detailed instructions on each step.

## Acknowledgments
This project is part of a series aimed at creating a comprehensive AirBnB clone. Your efforts in building the command interpreter will serve as the foundation for subsequent stages of the project.

Happy coding!
